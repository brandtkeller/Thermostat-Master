# Thermostat Main Display Unit

Main backend server for the Open Thermostat integration system

## Standard Communication

The main server exists on a single device (Raspberry Pi) and contains RESTful interfacing, scheduling, and physical control of the HVAC unit via C-wire. As this device is usually located outside of the monitored region (garage or other closet) it relies on temperature nodes to enroll and simply await for a request of current temperature. 

This architecture will allow multiple nodes to enroll and enhance the temperature view of the house as a whole.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a .jar package that can be transferred from a Development machine or built on a Raspberry Pi. 

### Prerequisites

Necessary items to compile and run the server

```
JDK 1.8 or later
Maven 3.2+
Docker (when containerizing)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Compile

```
mvn compile
```

Package

```
mvn package
```

Run

```
java -jar ./target/thermo-mdu-0.0.1.jar
```

The server will now be running on port 8080.
See below for running command line manual testing.

## Manual testing
